1. [The OS Dev Wiki] <br>
This is a pretty good link if you're looking to build an operating systems from scratch. The pages here have a pretty hands-on way of explaining certain topics. It is also a good link if you're looking to truly dive deep into operating systems as it covers many aspects of an operating systems and various architectures in great detail. Overall, a great general reference for this course in my opinion.
