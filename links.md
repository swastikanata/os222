# LINKS

1. [The OS Dev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/) <br>
This is a pretty good link if you're looking to build an operating systems from scratch. The pages here have a pretty hands-on way of explaining certain topics. It is also a good link if you're looking to truly dive deep into operating systems as it covers many aspects of an operating systems and various architectures in great detail. Overall, a great general reference for this course in my opinion.

2. [Learning Awk Is Essential For Linux Users](https://github.com/gibranoderenz/os222/blob/main/youtube.com/watch?v=9YOZmI-zWok) <br>
The speaker give some examples that make the viewer understand the concept and usage of awk pretty easily. I am a total beginner of things like this but this video is very understandable.

3. [Grep Vs Sed Vs Awk](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/differences-between-grep-sed-awk/)<br>
I came to OS class knowing almost nothing about Grep, Sed, and Awk. In the middle of the class I learned some of the commands but didn't know what they are actually used for. This link is very helpful to give you basic understanding about the differences between grep, sed, and awk. It's a documentation but pretty understandable and has some examples.

4. [What is a Checksum?](https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/)<br>
Cheksum was mentioned a couple of times but I don't know what it is. This link basically gives me some idea about it.

5. [Chmod Quick Reference](https://quickref.me/chmod)<br>
We learned about permission in the second class of week 2, so we were using the command chmod a lot. I was quite lost during the class so I tried to find helpful resources. This link is a great quick reference sheet for learning about Linux's file and directory permission system, its octal notation, as well as how to manipulate them using the chmod command.

6. [C Programming Language Tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-programming-language-tutorial)<br>
Learned C programming in week 2. The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.
